### by Mike Donovan

## Description

A C#/ASP.NET web app that allows a user to create a collection of vendors and associated orders.

## Technologies Used:
* C#
* .NET
* ASP.NET

## Setup/Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "VendorTracker". 
3. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS.
